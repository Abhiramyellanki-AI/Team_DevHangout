## 🎯 Problem Statement
*   **Assigned Problem / Company:** [Company Name:
                        Acceleron Labs Problem Statement:
Acceleron Labs deals extensively with government tenders that contain detailed product requirements and specifications. Currently, manually analyzing these complex 
specifications—which cover both hardware and software requirements—leads to inefficiencies and potential errors.The objective is to build a software-driven solution
to automate this process. The automated solution must be able to do the following:Targeted Extraction: Extract and identify hardware requirements (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage)
separately from software requirements (e.g., protocols, security, logs).File Handling: Process input documents that are primarily in PDF format, as well as occasional Excel
(XLS) formats.Structured Output: Organize and export all the extracted information into a structured Excel file.Adaptability: Interpret and decode different writing styles 
and representations, since requirement formats vary significantly across different documents.Technology: Utilize any LLM models or API keys (such as Google Gemini or Claude)
 to build the decoding and extraction logic.]
*   **The Challenge:** Manually extracting and comparing technical specifications (CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) from hundreds of pages of PDF tender documents is slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error.
*   **The Solution:** AccordLabs uses a dual-engine AI approach (Claude + Gemini) to automatically identify, clean, and standardize these specs into a unified format.
